There are many things I want to learn to do, but I don't have an easy way
to get into them. Are there fun things you want to do but don't know how
to start?
For example, rock climbing is something that I would love to learn how to do, 
but it seems daunting and a little scary for me to learn the ropes.

I've had so many fun and memorable activities, such as:
* backpacking, 
* camping,
* hiking, 
* biking, 
* tennis, 
* racquetball, 
* kayaking, 
* canoeing, and
* whitewater rafting.

All of those have one thing in common for me--a friend took me the first
time I did them. There are so many fun things to do in life, 
but a lot of times, doing them for the first time won't happen
unless there is a friend there to help show the way.

With the Pazilla resources and organized activities, I hope we can all make
lifelong fun experiences a lot more approachable than they are to
most people now. Can you think of anything that you'd love to do if only
a friend knew how and would be willing to take you? 
What kinds of things do you want to know how to do? What
kinds of things do you already know, about which would be useful to share skills
with others, or to have friends organize activities?
Please post in the comments or send me a note.

free and customizable resources here in each area.
